# Electric Knuckles

> Press trigger to perform a lightning clad boost dash. Blow target significantly when hit.

Damage dealt with Electric Punch is **150 hp** with knockback power of **120**. It also destroys Legacy's shield with single hit as shield damage is **9999**.

Damage dealt when punched without charging it does only **50 hp** damage, so you definetly want to make sure that you can do a charged hit.

Throwing the knuckles at the opponent does **20 hp** damage as expected.

Some miscellaneous stats:

* Knockback power of hit without charge: 30


## Electric Punch 

For successful Electric punch, the Knuckles must be in *ElectricPunch* state when you collide with the enemy. Activating the *ElectricPunch* is done by dashing / pressing trigger with the same hand that is holding the knuckles. The duration of the *ElectricPunch* state depends on the runners dash time length. This is either 0.4 or 0.5 seconds for most runners, except for Valkyrie, who has it at only 0.1 seconds. This means that with Valkyrie, you have a 0.1 second time window between dashing and hitting an opponent for a successful Electric punch. This makes it difficult to use Electric Knuckles with Valkyrie.
