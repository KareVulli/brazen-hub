> A gun with low round count but with high damage.   

Well the damage is not that high, but still pretty good as a long range sidearm for Legacy for example.
<!-- TODO: Test stats -->
The bullets do **50 hp** damage to opponents and have a range of **80 units**.

As it is not meant to be used as a melee weapon, damage dealt when punched with it is **30 hp**, and **20 hp** when thrown at an opponent. 

Some miscellaneous stats:

* Bullet speed: 320 units/second
* Fire rate: 0.3 seconds per bullet
* Min spread: 0
* Max spread: 2
